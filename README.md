## Abstract
Undetected faults in Boeing 737 aircraft pose significant safety risks and contribute to costly unscheduled downtime. This project advances fault detection by developing a QDA algorithm trained on the NASA CMAPSS FD001 dataset, simulating 20,631 turbofan engine cycles. The workflow includes feature standardization, Remaining Useful Life (RUL) labeling, class balancing with SMOTE, and robustness validation under noise. The resulting model achieves 99% accuracy, 94% recall, and an AUC of 0.9955, surpassing FAA safety benchmarks. Results demonstrate QDAâ€™s capability to strengthen predictive maintenance and operational efficiency in aviation.

## Methodology
- **Data Source:** NASA CMAPSS FD001 dataset (simulated turbofan engine cycles)
- **Preprocessing:**
	- Feature selection and standardization
	- RUL labeling (fault if RUL < 20 cycles)
	- Class balancing using SMOTE
- **Model:** Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- **Evaluation:**
	- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC
	- Robustness tested by adding Gaussian noise
	- Visualizations: ROC curves, confusion matrices, feature importance

## Results
- **Test Accuracy:** 99%
- **Test Recall:** 94%
- **Test AUC:** 0.9955
- **Confusion Matrix:** Only 6 false negatives and 152 false positives on 13,096 test cycles
- **Feature Importance:** Key sensors (e.g., T30, P30, Wf_Ps30) are most predictive
- **Comparison:** Outperforms prior work (Xia et al. 2025) in scope and accuracy
